    <p>It is almost impossible these days to read a business article or participate in a seminar without stumbling over
        such
        popularities as &quot;learning organizations,&quot; &quot;empowerment,&quot; or &quot;reengineering.&quot; It is
        equally common to encounter in the scientific community the study of complex adaptive systems, commonly referred
        to
        as &quot;complexity.&quot; I find it cumbersome to either think or write about fundamental principles underlying
        both physical systems and human institutions in the terms unique to either business or science. So after
        grubbing in
        various lexicons for a suitable word to describe the kind of organization discussed here, it seemed simpler to
        construct one. Since the knowledge pursued is believed by scientists to lie on the knife's edge between chaos
        and
        order, the first syllable of each was borrowed and Cha&ndash;ord (kay&ndash;ord) emerged.</p>

    <br>

    <p>By Chaord, I mean any self&ndash;organizing, adaptive, nonlinear, complex system, whether physical, biological,
        or
        social, the behavior of which exhibits characteristics of both order and chaos or, loosely translated to
        business
        terminology, cooperation and competition.</p>
    <br>

    <p>But first, let me introduce a particularly rich, robust chaord and then relate it to the principles presented
        here.

    <p>The VISA card had its genesis four decades ago as a California service of the Bank of America called
        BankAmericard.
        In response, five California banks jointly launched MasterCharge in 1966. In turn, Bank of America franchised
        its
        service. Other large banks quickly launched proprietary cards and offered franchises. Action and reaction were
        soon
        rampant. Bank after bank issued cards with little regard for customer qualifications, while television screamed
        such
        blather as, &quot;The card you won't go berserk with,&quot; a challenge the public accepted with enthusiasm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By 1968, the infant industry was out of control. Operating, credit, and fraud losses were believed to be in the
        tens
        of millions of dollars. Life magazine ran a cover story depicting banks as Icarus flying to the sun on wings of
        plastic above a red sea labeled losses, into which banks were soon to plunge, wings melted, and drown. In the
        midst
        of the mess, Bank of America called a meeting of its licensees to discuss operating problems. The meeting
        quickly
        disintegrated into acrimonious argument. In desperation, the bank proposed forming a committee of seven, of
        which I
        was one, to propose solutions to the more critical problems, which the bank would then attempt to implement. How
        I
        came to be there has relevance, so a bit of biography. (To see the whole article, click here.)</p>
